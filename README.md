# Project: Human Activity Recognition with Smartphones
## My Capstone Project in the Machine Learning Engineer Nanodegree at [Udacity](https://www.udacity.com/)

### Project Overview
This project is about recognizing human behavior with a smartphone. A smartphone is constantly measuring its movement and when its owner is carrying it, these measurements can be used for guessing its ownerâ€™s activity. In this project, we have six activities which we are trying to predict. These activities are WALKING, WALKING_UPSTAIRS, WALKING_DOWNSTAIRS, SITTING, STANDING and LAYING.

### Install

This project requires **Python 2.7** and the following Python libraries installed:

- [NumPy](http://www.numpy.org/)
- [Pandas](http://pandas.pydata.org)
- [matplotlib](http://matplotlib.org/)
- [scikit-learn](http://scikit-learn.org/stable/)

You will also need to have software installed to run and execute a [Jupyter Notebook](http://jupyter.org/)
